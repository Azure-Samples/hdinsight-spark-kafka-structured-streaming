# Use Spark Structured Streaming with Apache Spark and Kafka on HDInsight

This example contains a Jupyter notebook that demonstrates how to use Apache Spark structured streaming with Apache Kafka on HDInsight.

Note: This example requires Spark 2.2.0, which is available in HDInsight 3.6. The Spark and Kafka clusters must also be in the same Azure Virtual Network. To create a resource group containing all the services needed for this example, use the resource manager template in the [Use Spark Structured Streaming with Kafka](http://docs.microsoft.com/azure/hdinsight/hdinsight-apache-kafka-spark-structured-streaming) document.
